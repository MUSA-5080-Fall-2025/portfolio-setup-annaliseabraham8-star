The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

Tracts with smaller populations consistently show higher margins of error for race and ethnicity variables, often exceeding the 15% threshold we defined for reliability concerns. In addition, tracts with higher shares of minority residentsâ€”particularly Hispanic and Black populationsâ€”are more likely to have elevated uncertainty in their demographic estimates. These findings indicate that the reliability of ACS data is unevenly distributed, with some communities consistently at a disadvantage.\n\nThis uneven distribution of reliability has important equity implications. Communities that are rural, sparsely populated, or home to significant minority populations face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias. If public agencies or partner organizations treat ACS point estimates as precise without accounting for uncertainty, decisions around resource allocation, service provision, or equity monitoring could systematically disadvantage these groups. In practice, the populations already most vulnerable to underinvestment and underrepresentation in surveys are also the ones most likely to be mischaracterized by models built on noisy or unstable data.\n\nThe root causes of these data quality disparities lie in both statistical and structural factors. Survey sampling variability is highest where population counts are low, leading to inflated margins of error in small tracts. At the same time, nonresponse and undercoverage are more common in communities with higher proportions of immigrants, renters, and low-income households. These factors compound one another, producing both unreliable estimates and heightened risk of algorithmic bias. The patterns observed are thus not only statistical artifacts but reflections of deeper structural inequities in data collection and representation.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Department should adopt a multi-layered strategy. In the short term, all products and models should explicitly incorporate margins of error, with unreliable tracts either flagged, down-weighted, or aggregated to higher levels of geography. In the medium term, statistical smoothing methods and fairness audits can reduce the impact of noisy inputs on decision-making. Over the long term, investment in targeted data collection and stronger transparency requirements will be necessary to ensure that all communities are represented with sufficient accuracy. By embedding data reliability standards into analytic workflows, the Department can both mitigate bias and build greater trust in its use of demographic data.]\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# -

The counties with moderate confidence data include Cameron, Carbon, Elk, Forest, Greene, Montour, Snyder, Sullivan, Union, and Warren counties. Monitoring could include tracking discrepancies or unusual trends or flagging certain results for human review.]\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** None\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n[List 2-3 questions that your analysis raised that you'd like to explore further in future assignments. Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.\n\nHow can data be assessed if all tracts have high margins of error? How can we judge whether certain issues or traits are spatially signifigant?]\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on [9.29.25]\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version [your version]\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [your portfolio URL]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n[Describe any decisions you made about data processing, county selection, or analytical choices that might affect reproducibility]\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size issues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.]\"\n\n---\n\n\"## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
